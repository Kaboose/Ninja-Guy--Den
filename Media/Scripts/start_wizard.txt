Welcome, Den, to the world of ninjas!
Today is the start of an exciting journey.
You have been chosen to weild the mighty
sword of Denver. Hold it close, as it
may be the only tangible piece of this
world that you can trust.
To use the sword, use the left mouse button.
There may be some battles in which you
need range, however. I've heard that you
are quite the expert with shuriken. I believe
I saw some in that treasure chest over there!
Why don't you go collect them and try
them out on that orc there?
To use your ninja stars, use the right
mouse button!
